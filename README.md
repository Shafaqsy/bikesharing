## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis,we use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we have created a set of visualizations to as well. 
1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## RESULT

This graph tells us that most of the bike tripes are taken under half an hour.

This tells us that most of the costumers are male who uses this bike trip service.

This trip by weekday per hour graph tells us that Thursday evening are the peek hours.

Again, this graph showing by gender Male number of bike trips are higher specially in the evening.

The best time for bike repair is 2PM TO 4PM because the graph shows it's not bust during these hours.

This tells us the bike stations from which recorded bike trips stop. The size of the circles and darkness of the blue indicate the number of trips stop at those locations.

## SUMMARY
Overall, 
### Two Visualization:
1. I think we should find out if there is any station that is not in use at all.
2. We can also find the bike trip duration by birth year and gender to find out if there is any certain age of people mostly like to take the bike trip.
